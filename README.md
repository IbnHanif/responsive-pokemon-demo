# 🐉 Charmander Evolution via Media Queries

A fun and responsive Pokémon-themed web page where resizing the screen evolves Charmander into Charmeleon and then Charizard — purely using HTML and CSS.



## 🚀 Features

- 📱 Mobile-first design
- 🎨 Uses `media queries` to simulate Pokémon evolution
- 🌈 Adaptive background images based on screen width
- 🎮 Pure HTML + CSS (no JavaScript!)

## 💡 How It Works

This project uses `@media` queries in CSS to change the background image of a div as the screen size increases:

- `< 500px`: Shows Charmander
- `500–600px`: Shows Charmeleon
- `> 600px`: Shows Charizard

All images are centered and responsive.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries)
- Flexbox (used in other projects)
- Vanilla assets — no frameworks

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use media queries for responsive design
- Thinking like a frontend dev (screen width as a trigger)
- Creating UI feedback through resizing (like touch interactions)

## 🎯 Future Ideas

- Add sound effects on evolution
- Transition animations between Pokémon
- Add a “Click to Evolve” JavaScript version
